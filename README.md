Helph - GADS Community Project - Health Team 13

## Project Overview 
* Patients in most African countries are faced with the problem of easily getting the drugs prescribed from the hospital at the right time.
This is mostly because of the lack of information concerning pharmacies which have these drugs in their current stock. In addition to the
above mentioned problem, older people find it difficult to take their drugs at the right time since they have to be reminded to do so.

## Project Goal
* The goal of this project is to design and develop an android application to solve the above mentioned problems. This application is meant
to help patients easily have access to their prescribed drugs by directing them to nearby pharmacies which have the drugs in their current stock,
in addition to that, the application will help remind patients to take their drugs using alarm notifications.
